# GNOME Wallpaper Mode

This GNOME Extension will change your desktop wallpaper in a given time. It is a fork of [gnome-wallpaper-mode](https://github.com/Jomik/gnome-wallpaper-mode). Also, it uses *Transparent Topbar* internally. 

## Main goals

* Enjoy all the wallpapers you admire. 
* You have a multi-monitor setup, and sometimes, you only use one of them while the others are just waiting (and burning their pixels away).
* You sit in front of the computer, and you need to see the different colors of the visible spectrum to simulate real life.

# Features

* Has adjustable shortcut in the status bar (the fork did not provide an option for)
* Can make status bar semi-transparent
* Simplified usage
* Up-to-date code 

## Notes

I removed some of the features that I find unnecessary. For instance, you can only choose folders as a source.
