# GNOME Wallpaper Mode

Save the pixels on your monitor (literally) by showing different wallpapers all the time. A fork of [gnome-wallpaper-mode](https://github.com/Jomik/gnome-wallpaper-mode) and includes the *Transparent Topbar* extension. 

## Main goals

* Enjoy all of the wallpapers you admire. 
* You have a multi-monitor setup, and sometimes, you only use one of them while the others are just waiting (and burning their pixels away).
* You sit in front of the computer, and you need to see the different colors of the visible spectrum to simulate real life.

# How does it work?

The idea is to use different pixels all the time. Where the background is usually a single color (e.g., status bar), the pixels may wear out, and the static image may leave a mark (depending on the screen type) after long hours of work. This extension changes the wallpaper and makes the status bar semi-transparent for them to last longer.

# Features

* Has adjustable shortcut in the status bar (the fork did not provide an option for)
* Can make status bar semi-transparent
* Simplified usage
* Up-to-date code 

## Notes

I removed some of the features that I find unnecessary. For instance, you can only choose folders as a source.
